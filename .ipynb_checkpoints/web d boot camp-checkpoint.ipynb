    "Youtube\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Goal of your product: indexing and hosting all videos. Video Streaming.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Scope of your system: Streamers/Content Creators, Viewers, Avertisers all of them will use your system either to post or watch videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Design for the right scalability: We have to build for 10^9 people. We are taking and giving video content primarily. What is the average data i/o from our server? What kind of file system to use on our server to make the video transfer faster? Multi-processing by analyzing the traffic. Whatever code youtube devs push here has to work and deployed without altering user experience?\n",

    "Extra Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1) How would you record stats about videos e.g the total number of views, up-votes/down-votes, etc.\n",
